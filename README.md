Description
-----
We started using KiCad because we wanted to embrace a fully open-sourced and free solution. It's a powerful tool that is fully capable as a PCB design suite.

However, switching to KiCad meant sacrificing significant former efforts we put into creating vast libraries for our previous PCB design tool -- Eagle CAD. This frustrated us at first and has significantly slowed our momentum as we've transitioned to KiCad. We viewed losing all of our previous work as the single largest barrier to entry for KiCad. Although we really wanted to embrace the software for so many reasons, it was rather difficult to leave all of our existing content behind. As we struggled to get motivated, we began to realize that starting over in KiCad could be a good thing for us. We've learned a lot about consistency and best practices over time, but some of our initial work in Eagle didn't live up to some of our more developed standards. This meant with KiCad we'd get all that right from the beginning.

It also provided what we see as a tremendous opportunity to contribute to the KiCad community. By posting all of our libraries, modules, and templates as we grow in KiCad, we're hoping everyone in the KiCad community can benefit as well. Over time, the expectation is that this will become a rather complete set of useful KiCad content that everyone can enjoy.
